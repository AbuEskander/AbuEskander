Hey, stranger 👋  
You’ve stumbled into the digital corner of **Basil Ismail** — a curious mind tangled in wires, bits, and bold ideas.

## 🧠 The Backstory

I’m not just learning tech — I’m living it.

By day, I’m wrapping up my Computer Engineering degree at **BAU**.  
By night (and most other times too), I’m deep in the code trenches at **42 Amman**, where we learn by doing — and failing — and doing again. It’s beautiful.

Somewhere along the way, I built a **Smart Mirror**, coded my own **Shell**, and dived into the world of **AI and raytracing**. I like weird projects. Weird teaches better than tutorials.

## 🛠️ What’s in My Toolkit

- **Languages I speak (to machines):** `C`, `C++`, `Python`, `JavaScript`, `Shell`
- **Weapons of choice:** `GCC`, `GDB`, `Neovim`, `WSL`, `VS Code`, `Git`, `Valgrind`, `Postman`
- **Battlefields:** Linux, system programming, AI playgrounds, full-stack chaos, and embedded puzzles

## 🌱 What I'm Chasing

- Becoming a master of system-level programming (and maybe the kernel 👀)  
- Writing code that isn’t just smart — but **scalable**, **clean**, and **human**  
- Working better with others (yes, even when I’d rather do it all myself)  
- Turning ideas into tools that actually **matter**

## ⚡ Proton-Powered Facts

- I love protons. Why? Because they’re **positive**, **charged**, and **never alone** — kinda like the people I vibe with.  
- I believe **efficiency is an art** and **bugs are just misunderstood features.**  
- One day, I’ll build something big. For now, I’m just building.
